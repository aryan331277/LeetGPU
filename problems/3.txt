Matrix Transpose
Easy
Write a program that transposes a matrix of 32-bit floating point numbers on a GPU. The transpose of a matrix switches its rows and columns. Given a matrix 
 of dimensions 
, the transpose 
 will have dimensions 
. All matrices are stored in row-major format.

Implementation Requirements
Use only native features (external libraries are not permitted)
The solve function signature must remain unchanged
The final result must be stored in the matrix output
