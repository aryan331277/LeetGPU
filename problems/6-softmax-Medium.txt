Softmax
Medium
Write a program that computes the softmax function for an array of 32-bit floating-point numbers on a GPU. The softmax function is defined as follows:


Your solution should handle potential overflow issues by using the "max trick". Subtract the maximum value of the input array from each element before exponentiation.

Implementation Requirements
Use only native features (external libraries are not permitted)
The solve function signature must remain unchanged
The final result must be stored in the array output
