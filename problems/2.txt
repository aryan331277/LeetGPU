Matrix Multiplication
Easy
Write a program that multiplies two matrices of 32-bit floating point numbers on a GPU. Given matrix 
 of dimensions 
 and matrix 
 of dimensions 
, compute the product matrix 
, which will have dimensions 
. All matrices are stored in row-major format.

Implementation Requirements
Use only native features (external libraries are not permitted)
The solve function signature must remain unchanged
The final result must be stored in matrix C
